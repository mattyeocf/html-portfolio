<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am an educator who believes strongly in building systems that make work more efficient and meaningful. Over the years, I have led programmes, coordinated large scale initiatives, and worked closely with diverse groups of people, experiences that shaped how I approach problem solving, with clarity, structure, and empathy.
</p>

<p>My interest in web development grew from a simple goal, to create practical tools that improve workflows and user experiences. I enjoy breaking complex problems into clean, functional solutions, and I am especially drawn to designing platforms that are intuitive and purposeful.</p>

<p>As I transition deeper into tech, I bring with me strong planning skills, attention to detail, and a mindset focused on continuous growth. I value thoughtful design, reliable functionality, and technology that serves real needs. This portfolio reflects my journey as a learner and builder, and I look forward to creating solutions that make a difference.</p>
