<h1>My Top 3 Movies Recommendations</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Spirited Away</h3>
<p>Spirited Away is a great movie because it blends imagination with very human themes like courage, identity, and growing up. What I appreciate most is how Chihiro starts off fearful and uncertain, yet learns to adapt, take responsibility, and care for others. The world is strange but never meaningless, every character and detail adds depth. It reminds me that growth often comes from being thrown into the unfamiliar, and that quiet resilience can be more powerful than bravado.</p>
<h3>Inception</h3>
<p>Inception is a great movie because it makes us think while delivering an incredibly engaging story. The layered dreams mirror how complex our own thoughts and memories can be. What I enjoy most is that at its core it is really about guilt, letting go, and the hope of returning home. It is the kind of film that gets better with every rewatch, each time you notice something you missed before.</p>
<h3>Artificial Intelligence</h3>
<p>Artificial Intelligence is a great movie because it goes beyond sci-fi and asks a very simple question, what makes someone human? David’s need to be loved feels real, and it makes you reflect on how we treat others, especially those who depend on us. The film is uncomfortable at times, but that is what makes it powerful.</p>
